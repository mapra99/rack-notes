# Rake!

## What is Rack?
Rack is a library to build HTTP ruby applications. It's used widely on the ruby ecosystems, being implemented inside rails, sinatra and grape. It also has the ability to integrate with webservers like puma and unicorn.

Rack serves as a glue between the webserver and the app code.

Why using Rack? Rack is super fast. If there's no need for helpers that Rails and Sinatra provides, building a fast API is very easy with Rack.
